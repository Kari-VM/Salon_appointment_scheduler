# Salon_appointment_scheduler

This is the third project under freecodecamp's Relational Database Certification

It has 2 files
- salon.sql containing the salon's database
- salon.sh for inserting data and querying the database

### Description

salon.sql

It contains 3 tables. A "services" table listing the services provided by the salon, a "customers" table containing the names of customers and their phone number and
an "appointments", containing the details of services to various customers at the appointed time. This table has TWO FOREIGN KEYS each of which references the PRIMARY KEY from the services and customers table.

salon.sh

This file contains all the bash script for inserting the data into the customers and appointments table and for querying the database.

### Learning Experience:
In this project I had to repeat most of the commands I previously learnt in PostgreSQL and bash. 

Something new that I learnt was how to maintain a database for a service entity, how to display the right and relevant messages to the users based on input entered and how to take them to the relevant menu based on such input.
